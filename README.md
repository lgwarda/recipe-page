## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. The rule `td:last-child` targets the last td element in each row, applying the var `(--brown-800)` color only to the numerical values.

```css
/* Table Styles */
table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

th,
td {
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--stone-150);
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: left;
}

th {
  background-color: var(--stone-150);
}

/* Set color for only the numerical values in the last column */
td:last-child {
  color: var(--brown-800); /* Match the h2 color */
}
```

2. List Styling:

- Used ::before pseudo-elements for better control of bullet points and numbers
- Implemented custom counter for numbered list
- Maintained consistent spacing and alignment

```css
/* Lists */
ul {
    padding-left: 24px;
    margin: 24px 0;
    list-style: none;
}

ul li {
    margin-bottom: 12px;
    padding-left: 12px;
    position: relative;
    color: var(--stone-600);
}

ul li::before {
    content: "â€¢";
    color: var(--brown-800);
    position: absolute;
    left: -12px;
```
